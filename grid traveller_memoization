/*Say that you are traveller on a 2D grid.You begin in the top left corner and your goal
is to travel to the bottom right corner.You may only move down or right.

In how man ways can you travel to the goal on the grid with dimensions  m*n?

//c[0,0]
d[0,0]=(-1,-1)
//can only move up
d[r,0]=(r-1,0)
//can only move right
reward[0,c]=d[0,c-1]


recursive case:
 for r-1 to m-1
     for c=1...n-1
         if reward [r-1,c]>reward[r,c-1])
             then d[r,c]=(r-1,c)
             else
             d[r,c]=(r,c-1)
             
   return d
